Project Axle - People Management Toolkit


Project Overview
Development of a dual-interface knowledge assistant (codenamed "Axle") for Eastern Western Motor Group (EWMG) based loosely on mAint. The system will provide separate interfaces for managers and employees, using content from Page Tiger and potentially other sources (specified domains, videos, and attached files in the page tiger interface).
Key Components
Manager Interface: Chat interface to access management-specific HR policies and procedures
Employee Interface: Chat interface to access general employee HR information
Page Tiger Integration: Automated content scraping and processing from your existing system
Analytics Reporting: Weekly summaries of usage and query patterns (currently out of immediate scope)

Detailed Process Description
1. Content Management
The system continuously monitors and processes PageTiger to ensure the knowledge base remains current:
Content Acquisition: 
Automated scraping of Page Tiger content on a conditional basis
Change detection system to identify modifications in existing content
Comparison of current and previous content versions to pinpoint changes (if needed)
Processing of relevant datasets
Update Tracking System: 
Continuous monitoring of Page Tiger content for modifications
Differential analysis to identify specific changes between versions
Timestamp tracking for all content updates
Version history maintenance for audit and rollback capabilities
Content Processing: 
Text and image extraction and cleaning to remove formatting artifacts
Structural analysis to identify sections, headings, and relationships
Entity recognition to identify key concepts and terminology
Content chunking optimised for vector database storage
Knowledge Base Creation: 
Conversion of processed text into vector embeddings using mAint Prism API
Organisation of content into manager and employee knowledge bases
Metadata tagging for improved retrieval accuracy
Relationship mapping between related content pieces
2. Authentication & Access Control
The system will use AzureAD integration for role-based access:
AzureAD Integration: 
Direct integration with EWMG's existing AzureAD environment
Secure Single Sign-On (SSO) capability
Automatic role recognition based on AzureAD groups
Smooth authentication experience for users
Role-Based Access Control: 
Manager and employee interfaces determined by AzureAD roles or separate URL??
Content access restrictions based on user permissions
Automatic routing to appropriate knowledge base
Response Generation: 
Retrieved content is organised and formatted
Natural language response is generated
Citations to source documents are included
Conversation Management: 
Conversation history is maintained for context
Follow-up questions are understood in context
3. Analytics and Reporting (Out of Scope)
The system collects and analyses usage data to improve performance:
Data Collection: 
User queries and conversation flows
Response quality and user feedback
System performance metrics
Knowledge base coverage analysis
Report Generation: 
Weekly summary reports are generated automatically
Reports include usage statistics and common queries
Identified gaps are highlighted
System performance metrics are included
